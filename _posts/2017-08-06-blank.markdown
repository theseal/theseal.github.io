I have been wanting to do this for a long time, since about the time I
received and configured my new MacBook Esc at work. That's probably
half a year ago.

I have always used a blank screen saver on my Macs. But since some
releases back of macOS (OS X really) Apple no longer ships the OS with
an blank
alternative.

Why a screen saver you may ask, why not just turn off the display (lock
the computer)? External monitors is my answer to that. External
monitors take ages to start from wake and that is not an alternative
when you SHOULD lock your computer each time you leave your desk.

So there are alternatives for this. The probably most used one is a
[black screen saver made by
Dr. Lex](https://www.dr-lex.be/software/screensavers.html). This one
works just great but is from my knowledge not open-source and is huge
(7KiB compressed ðŸ˜‰)!

Another way to come around this problem can be found on
[superuser.com](https://superuser.com/a/328670).  That also works great
and feels better than downloading a binary from Dr.  Lex. But the
installation process is a little bit bulky so I wasn't 100% pleased.

So this week I took the superuser.com alternative and made it ever
smaller (1KiB!) and put it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/theseal/macos-blank-screensaver). The file
is still an binary ([a
        plist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_list)) but can be
opened with [Graphics Tools for
Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=graphics%20tools%20for%20xcode).
As close to open-source as I can get. To make the installation easier I
made a [brew](https://brew.sh) [cask](https://caskroom.github.io)
[tap](https://github.com/theseal/homebrew-blank-screensaver).

The installation is almost too easy if you have `brew` installed
already.

* Run:

```
brew tap theseal/blank-screensaver
brew cask install blank-screensaver
```
* Activate the screen saver in the `Desktop & Screen saver`
prefPane.


Enjoy!

And as always, patches are welcome. ðŸ™‚

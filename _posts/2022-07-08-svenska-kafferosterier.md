title:  "Swedish coffee roasteries"

During the pandemic [Simon](https://soy.se) and I have grown in to specialty coffee. In the begining we used a list of swedish roasters hosted at kaffebryggan.com (which are now only accessable through [web.archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20210812131008/https://www.kaffebryggan.com/svenska-kafferosterier/)) to find roasteries and coffee to try. The list was very helpful.

In order to help others find and try really good (hopefully locally roasted) coffee I recreated the list on [svenska-kafferosterier.rymdvarel.se](https://svenska-kafferosterier.rymdvarel.se). Enjoy the reading (and coffee) and help us keep the list up to date with an [issue or PR](https://github.com/svenska-kafferosterier/svenska-kafferosterier.github.io).

🇸🇪☕️

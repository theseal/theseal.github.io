My name is Johan and I'm some kind of computer guy working as a system administrator mainly with Linux.

# So, from what I can understand you are from Sweden. Why do you write in english?
Two reasons:

1. I need to practice my english more.
2. I intend to write tech stuff here and from my experience that's harder in swedish(and I hate tech-"svengelska").
